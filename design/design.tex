\section{Optimal Donation Under Risk is Bounded}

Assume that we have an agents whose endowment may be either $e_1$ or $e_2$ with probability $p$ and $1-p$ respectively.  Let $e_1 > e_2$, so state 1 is the ``good" state and state 2 is the ``bad" state.  Then in our design the agent chooses a donation amount $x$ to satisfy
\[
\max_{x \in [0, e_2]} p u(e_1 - x, x) + (1-p) u(e_2 - x, x)
\]
where the utility function $u$ satisfies $u_1>0, u_2>0$ and $u_{11}>0, u_{22}>0$.  That is, more money for either the agent or the other party is better (holding the other amount fixed), but there are decreasing returns.  Additionally, for what follows we will need to assume that $u_{12} < 0$, meaning that as the agent's own income increases, the marginal returns to increasing the other party's income are decreasing.

Note that if we write $D =  [0, e_2]$ and $f(x, p) = p u(e_1 - x, x) + (1-p) u(e_2 - x, x)$ this problem can be rewritten as
\[
\max_{x \in [0, e_2]} f(x, p),
\]
which allows us to apply the Topkis theorem.  The condition for the theorem to be met are as follows.

\begin{enumerate}

\item $D$ is a lattice.  This is trivially true for a line segment.

\item $f$ is supermodular in $x$.  This is trivially true since there is a single choice variable.

\item $f$ has increasing differences in $(x, p)$.  This is satisfied if $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial p \partial x} \geq 0$.  Note that 
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial p} = u(e_1 - x, x) - u(e_2 - x, x) 
\]
so 
\[
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial p \partial x} = -u_1(e_1 - x, x) + u_2(e_1 - x, x) + u_1(e_2 - x, x) - u_2(e_2 - x, x) 
\]
which we can rearrange to get
\[
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial p \partial x}   u_1(e_2 - x, x) -u_1(e_1 - x, x) + u_2(e_1 - x, x) - u_2(e_2 - x, x)  .
\]
Note that the first two terms, $u_1(e_2 - x, x) -u_1(e_1 - x, x)$, sum to a positive number by our assumption that $u_{11} > 0$.  The second two terms, $u_2(e_1 - x, x) - u_2(e_2 - x, x)$, will also sum to a positive number by our assumption that $u_{12} < 0$.  Thus $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial p \partial x} > 0$ as desired.
\end{enumerate}


Since all the Topkis conditions are satisfied, we can then claim that the optimal choice of $x^*(p)$ is non-decreasing in in $p$.    In particular suppose we let $x^*(1)$ be the optimal donation when $p=1$ (so the endowment is $e_1$ for certain), and $x^*(0)$ be the optimal donation when $p=0$ (so the endowment is $e_2$ for certain).  Then for any case where the endowment is uncertain, ie when $p \in (0,1)$, it must be that $x^*(0) < x^*(p) < x^*(1)$. That is, the optimal donation under risk is somewhere between the optimal donations under the good and bad states.
